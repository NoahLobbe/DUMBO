How version system works, V.W.XY.Z
 * V is either 'b' or 'm' to indicate a branch or master
 * W is iteration of completed product.
 * X is incremented when a big function/feature/sensor is added
 * Y is just code improvements, no new stuff as that would classify as X
 * Z is the name of the branch, or if master than just = 0

Version log
master
	| m.0.10.0 Added motor driver
	|
	| m.0.11.0 Moved motor driver code into a neat class
	|
	| m.0.20.0 Added PIR motion sensor
	|
	| m.0.21.0 Moved PIR motion sensor code into a neat class
	|	
	| m.0.30.0 Added Ultrasonic sensor
	|
	| m.0.31.0 Code modifications
	| 
	| m.0.32.0 More code modifications. Note for previous versions: if (distance <=minimum_turning_distance_mm) is in wrong spot to ever be executed...

branch_rebuild ##############make sure to mention this annoying bug in final solution
	| b.0.30.rebuild Stripping back to basics. PIR not implemented in main loop.
	|
	| b.0.40.rebuild Reintroducing previous_distance stuff


//really need to add an encoder to the motor output to determine travel distances//
