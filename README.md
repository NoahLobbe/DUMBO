# DUMBO
**D**efinitely **U**seless **M**ouse ro**B**ot **O**kay.

Project built off of an RC car. Unsure of this specifics as I bought it a second hand shop (bargain!) eons ago (in a galaxy far, far away...).
Maybe one of these?

## Protoype
All inside the folder `Prototype`. 
- Contains an .STL to 3D print to hold the rear assembly, of the RC car, in place, replacing the need of the original chassis cover.
- Code is a bit of a mess, so attempt to understand at your own peril.


## Finals
### 3D Printing
Contains .STL's and some slicing images


### Code
It is coming soon.
