Project built off an RC car. Unsure of this specifics as I bought it a second hand shop (bargain!) eons ago (in a galaxy far, far away...).
These are my two guesses, but I think the FCC had other RC cars with similiar chassis, so really hard to find the exact one.

## Protoype
All inside the folder `Prototype`. 
- Contains an .STL to 3D print to hold the rear assembly, of the RC car, in place, replacing the need of the original chassis cover.
- Code is a bit of a mess, so attempt to understand at your own peril.


## Finals
### 3D Printing
Contains .STL's and some slicing images


### Code
Coming soon.

### Images
Coming soon.
